@section{Introduction}

@margin-note{This is a ``living'' artifact: please submit bug reports
and pull requests whenever you spot problems in this document.
@url{https://github.com/dvanhorn/redex-aam-tutorial/}}


This article provides a brief introduction to the Redex programming
language for semantic modelling.  It does so by developing several
semantic models of a simple programming language and then showing how
to construct a program analyzer for this language using the
``Abstracting Abstract Machines'' method@~cite[bib:aam].

So this tutorial aims to accomplish two goals:

@itemlist[

@item{(1) to introduce semantic engineers (programming language
researchers, language designers and implementors, analysis and tool
builders, etc.) to the Redex programming language;}

@item{(2) to demonstrate the method of building abstract interpreters
known as AAM.}

]

You could read this tutorial for either purpose.  If you want to learn
Redex, this tutorial will build a bunch of standard semantic systems:
reduction relations, type judgments, evaluators, machines, and finally
a program analyzer.  If you want an explicit and approachable
introduction to the AAM method, this tutorial will walk you through a
detailed construction.

@subsection{What is Redex?}

Redex@~cite[bib:redex] is a scripting language and set of associated tools supporting
the conception, design, construction, and testing of semantic systems
such as programming languages, type systems, program logics, and
program analyses.  As a scripting language, it enables an engineer to
create executable specifications of common semantic elements such as
grammars, reduction relations, judgments, and metafunctions; the basic
elements of formal systems.  It includes a number of software
engineering inspired features to make models robust and includes tools
for typesetting models and generating algebraic steppers for exploring
program behaviors.  In brief, Redex supports all phases of the
semantic engineering life-cycle.

@margin-note{For an excellent talk motivating Redex, see the video of
Robby Findler's
@emph{@hyperlink["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuCRToctmw0"]{Run
Your Research}} talk at POPL 2012 @~cite[bib:run-your-research].}

I have used Redex since its first release and it has played a critical
role in several of my research projects.  It has allowed me to rapidly
explore new ideas, hypothesize claims, and---typically---refute these
claims and refine the ideas.  In some cases, Redex has eased the
development of research; I can go from idea to result much faster and
more effectively than I could without Redex.  In other cases, using
Redex has illuminated problems I did not know existed, leading to new
results and research.  But in other cases, I simply @emph{could not
have accomplished my research without Redex}.  

Redex has become such an integral tool in my research that I cannot
imagine my research path without it.  It has changed the way I
approach and think about problems.

@subsection{What is Abstracting Abstract Machines?}

Abstracting Abstract Machines (or AAM, for short) is a method for
systematically constructing sound program analyzers.  The central idea
is that a programming language's semantics can be transformed, by a
simple turn-the-crank construction, into an analysis for soundly
reasoning about programs written in that language.  It has been used
to analyze a number of language features often considered beyond the
pale of existing analysis approaches.  A key advantage of the approach
is that ideas from programming language design and implementation can
be directly imported and applied to the design and implementation of
abstract interpreters.

@subsection{Prerequisites}

This tutorial assumes you have some experience with programming
language semantic artifacts such as grammars, reduction relations,
evaluation relations, typing judgments.  If you have never seen these
before, you should probably start with a graduate PL text book
(e.g.@~cite[bib:redex]).  It does not assume you have a background in
program analysis or abstract interpretation.

This tutorial also assumes you have some experience with programming
in a Lisp-like language.  In particular, you should be comfortable
with the concepts behind @racket[quote], @racket[quasiquote], and
@racket[unquote].  Having programmed with pattern matching would also
help.

You will need @hyperlink["http://racket-lang.org/"]{Racket}, which is
very easy to install and works on all major operating systems.  At the
time of writing, version 6.9 is the latest release.

You can download the source code for this tutorial here:
@url{https://github.com/dvanhorn/redex-aam-tutorial/archive/master.zip}.

@section{Warmup}

Redex, at its core, is a language for defining and operating on
s-expressions that is equiped with a powerful pattern matching
mechanism.

@margin-note{To follow along with this tutorial, you must `(require redex)` immediately below your `#lang racket` definition in DrRacket.}

An s-expression is a potentially nested piece of data that may include
numbers, booleans, symbols, and lists of s-expressions.  Before
getting in to how to model semantics with Redex, let's just play with
some simple examples.

S-expressions are constructed with the @racket[term] form:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term 2)
(term fred)
(term ())
(term (fred (2) (() green)))
]

If you've ever programmed with a language in the LISP family, you can
first think of @racket[term] as being synonymous with @racket[quote].

A @deftech{language} is a set of s-expressions, defined by the
@racket[define-language] form.  For example:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-language L
  (M ::= N F (M ...))
  (F ::= fred wilma)
  (N ::= 2 7))]

This defines the language @racket[L].  The language @racket[L] is
inductively defined as the smallest set such that @racketresult[2],
@racketresult[7], @racketresult[fred], and @racketresult[wilma] are in
@racket[L], and if some values @emph{x@subscript{0}} through
@emph{x@subscript{n}} are in @racket[L], then the list containing
@emph{x@subscript{0}} through @emph{x@subscript{n}} is in @racket[L].

@margin-note{The use of capital letters for non-terminals is just a
convention I follow and not a requirement of Redex.}

The definition of @racket[L] takes the familiar form of a BNF-like
grammar.  The ``@racket[...]'' postfix operator indicates zero or
more repetitions of the preceding pattern.

In addition to @racket[L], this grammar also carves out
subsets of @racket[L] defined by the non-terminals of the grammar,
namely @racket[M], @racket[F], and @racket[N].  The non-terminal names
are significant because they become pattern variables which can be
used to match against elements of the language.

The simplest operation is to ask whether an s-expression is an element
of one of these sets.  For example:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(redex-match? L N (term 2))
(redex-match? L N (term 9))
(redex-match? L N (term fred))
(redex-match? L M (term (((((((fred)))))))))
]

In general, @racket[redex-match?] can use an arbitrary pattern, not
just a non-terminal name:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(redex-match? L (N ...) (term 2))
(redex-match? L (N ...) (term (7 2 7)))
(redex-match? L (M_1 M_2) (term (7 (2 fred))))
]

The last example demonstrates the use of subscripts in patterns, which
serve to distinguish multiple occurrences of the same non-terminal
name.  Had we left of the subscripts, the pattern would only match
lists of two @emph{identical} terms:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(redex-match? L (M M) (term (7 (2 fred))))
(redex-match? L (M M) (term ((2 fred) (2 fred))))
]

We can also define functions on terms, called @deftech{metafunctions}
using the @racket[define-metafunction] form.  A metafunction is given
by an ordered sequence of pattern and template clauses.  For example,
here is a function that swaps occurrences of @racketresult[fred] and
@racketresult[wilma]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction L
  swap : M -> M
  [(swap fred) wilma]
  [(swap wilma) fred]  
  [(swap (M ...)) ((swap M) ...)]
  [(swap M) M])
]

There are two imporant things to notice in this example: (1) the
clauses of metafunction definitions are ordered, so the last clause
matches only if the first three do not; (2) the use of
``@racket[...]'' can also occur on the right-hand side of clauses, so
the third clause distributes the @racket[swap] call to all of the
elements of the list.

Now we can see the difference between @racket[quote] and
@racket[term]: within the @racket[term] form, metafunctions are
interpreted:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term (swap (wilma fred)))
(eval:alts (code:quote (swap (wilma fred))) '(swap (wilma fred)))
(term (7 (swap (wilma 2 (fred)))))
]

It's important to note that metafunction exist within Redex terms and
are not functions in the host language.  Refering to metafunctions
outside of @racket[term] causes a syntax error:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(swap wilma)
]

Now that we have seen the basics, we can move on to a real example.

@section{PCF}

Let's start by building a model of a very simple, typed functional
programming language based on the PCF language@~cite[bib:pcf].
Although simple, PCF contains all the essential elements of a real
programming language.  Scaling the approach of these notes up to a
more sophisticated language is just a small matter of semantic
hacking.

PCF is a core typed functional programming language.  For values, it
includes natural numbers, functions, and primitive operations.  Terms
include variables, values, applications, conditionals, and recursive
functions.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-language PCF
  (M ::= 
     N O X L 
     (Î¼ (X : T) L)
     (M M ...) 
     (if0 M M M))
  (X ::= variable-not-otherwise-mentioned)
  (L ::= (Î» ([X : T] ...) M))
  (V ::= N O L)
  (N ::= number)
  (O ::= O1 O2)
  (O1 ::= add1 sub1)
  (O2 ::= + *)
  (T ::= num (T ... -> T)))
]

@margin-note{Greek symbols: you can enter Greek symbols in the
DrRacket IDE by typing many common LaTeX commands followed by
Control-\ (in OS X).  For example ``\sigma'' plus Control-\ will enter 
``Ï''. To make things easier, you can type a unique prefix, so ``\sig'' 
plus Control-\ will also enter a ``Ï'' as well.}

Compared with the warmup example, there's really not much to point
other than the use of @racket[variable-not-otherwise-mentioned], which
is just a shorthand way of saying what's @emph{not} a variable name;
in particular, any symbol mentioned in the grammar cannot be a
variable name, so for example @racketresult[Î»], @racketresult[Î¼],
@racketresult[if0], @racketresult[:], etc., cannot be used as variable
names.  (Had we just used @racket[variable] instead of
@racket[variable-not-otherwise-mentioned], nothing would break (yet),
but it would be ambiguous as to whether some expressions were
applications or lambda abstractions.  Down the line, that probably
will break some of the claims we expect to hold on the language.)

One thing that is missing from the grammar is the requirement that
@racketresult[Î»]-bound variables are distinct.  We could express this
side condition in the grammar, but instead we'll defer this
requirement to the typing judgment (which we'll see next).

As an example PCF program, here is a program that computes the
factorial of 5:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-term fact-5
  ((Î¼ (fact : (num -> num))
      (Î» ([n : num])
        (if0 n
             1
             (* n (fact (sub1 n))))))
   5))
]

(The @racket[define-term] form is way to bind a name interpreted
within @racket[term].)

We can write a test to make sure that this program is indeed in the
language @racket[PCF]: 
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(test-equal (redex-match? PCF M (term fact-5)) #t)]

@subsection{Typing judgement}

Let's now define a typing relation for PCF programs.  The typing
relation will, as usual, be defined in terms of a typing environment,
which is missing from the PCF grammar.  Rather than revising the
grammar, we can define a @deftech{language extension} as follows:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFT PCF
  (Î ::= ((X T) ...)))
]

The @racket[PCFT] language includes everything in the @racket[PCF]
language, plus a notion of type environments @racket[Î], which are
sequences of variable and type pairs.  (Language extensions can also
replace or augment existing non-terminals, as we'll see later.)

Let's first take a detour to develop some useful, general purpose
helper functions.

Association lists, like @racket[Î], come up again and again, so let's
define a few operations for them.  Since association lists are more
general than type environments, we'll want to define generic versions
of this operations.  In order to be generic, we should only use the
built-in patterns of Redex and not the metavariables of languages we
define.  To accomodate this, we first define the language of built-in
patterns:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-language REDEX)
]

This definition introduces no non-terminals, so it includes only the
built-in patterns like @racket[number], @racket[variable],
@racket[...], etc.  When we define generic operations, we will define
them in the language of @racket[REDEX].


First, let's write a straightforward recursive judgment form that
relates a given key to all its associations:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-judgment-form REDEX
  #:mode (lookup I I O)
  #:contract (lookup ((any any) ...) any any)
  [(lookup (_ ... (any any_0) _ ...) any any_0)])
]

This relation makes use of the @racket[any] pattern, which ranges
over all values.  It also uses the @racket[_] pattern, which like
@racket[any], will match anything, but unlike @racket[any] it is not a
binder and therefore (1) it cannot be used on the right hand side and
(2) multiple occurrences of @racket[_] on the left hand side are not
constrained to match the same thing.

The clause uses a non-linear pattern to require a binding to match the
given key (notice the two left-hand occurrences of @racket[any]).

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(judgment-holds (lookup ((x 1) (y 2) (x 3)) x 1))
(judgment-holds (lookup ((x 1) (y 2) (x 3)) x 2))
(judgment-holds (lookup ((x 1) (y 2) (x 3)) x 3))
(judgment-holds (lookup ((x 1) (y 2) (x 3)) x any) any)
]



In addition to looking up an association, we need an operation to
extend an association list.  A simple definition that allows for an
association to be extended with an arbitrary number of key-value pairs
is then:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction REDEX
  ext1 : ((any any) ...) (any any) -> ((any any) ...)
  [(ext1 (any_0 ... (any_k any_v0) any_1 ...) (any_k any_v1))
   (any_0 ... (any_k any_v1) any_1 ...)]
  [(ext1 (any_0 ...) (any_k any_v1))
   ((any_k any_v1) any_0 ...)])

(define-metafunction REDEX
  ext : ((any any) ...) (any any) ... -> ((any any) ...)
  [(ext any) any]
  [(ext any any_0 any_1 ...)
   (ext1 (ext any any_1 ...) any_0)])
]

The @racket[ext] metafunction overrides an existing association, if
there is one; otherwise it prepends the new association to the list.

Lastly, we will want to assert that @racket[Î»]-bound variables are
unique, so let's define a @racket[unique] predicate, which holds when
its arguments are distinct:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction REDEX
  unique : (any ...) -> boolean
  [(unique (any_!_1 ...)) #t]
  [(unique (_ ...)) #f])
]

This defines a @racket[unique] metafunction that takes a list of
any number of elements and produces @racket[#t] when they are unique and
@racket[#f] otherwise.  This uses a new kind of pattern, which uses
the @tt{_!} naming prefix.  The meaning of this pattern is that
repeated uses of it must be distinct, thus @racket[any_!_1 ...]
matches disjoint sequences.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term (unique ()))
(term (unique (1)))
(term (unique (1 2)))
(term (unique (1 2 3 2)))
]

There is a kind of short-hand for defining predicates (metafunctions
that produce either true or false), called, confusingly enough,
@racket[define-relation]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-relation REDEX
  unique â (any ...)
  [(unique (any_!_1 ...))])
]

It can be used just like a metafunction:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term (unique (1 2)))
(term (unique (1 2 3 2)))
]



With these generic operations in place, we can now define the typing
relation ``@racket[â¢]'':

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-judgment-form PCFT
  #:mode (â¢ I I I O)
  #:contract (â¢ Î M : T)  
  [(lookup Î X T)
   -------------- var
   (â¢ Î X : T)]  
  [------------- num
   (â¢ Î N : num)]  
  [----------------------- op1
   (â¢ Î O1 : (num -> num))]  
  [--------------------------- op2
   (â¢ Î O2 : (num num -> num))]  
  [(â¢ Î M_1 : num)
   (â¢ Î M_2 : T)
   (â¢ Î M_3 : T)
   --------------------------- if0
   (â¢ Î (if0 M_1 M_2 M_3) : T)]  
  [(â¢ (ext Î (X T)) L : T)
   ----------------------- Î¼
   (â¢ Î (Î¼ (X : T) L) : T)]  
  [(â¢ Î M_0 : (T_1 ..._1 -> T))
   (â¢ Î M_1 : T_1) ...  
   ----------------------- app
   (â¢ Î (M_0 M_1 ..._1) : T)]  
  [(unique (X ...))
   (â¢ (ext Î (X T) ...) M : T_n)
   ------------------------------------------ Î»
   (â¢ Î (Î» ([X : T] ...) M) : (T ... -> T_n))])
]

The @racket[define-judgment-form] specifies a @deftech{relation}.
Conceptually, a relation in Redex is a function from inputs to sets of
outputs and the definition of a relation must specify which positions
of the relation are inputs and which are outputs, as seen in the
@racket[#:mode] spec.  This relation has three inputs (although the
last one is always the constant ``@racketresult[:]'' to make the form
easier to read) and one output.  The two real inputs are the type
environment and term; the output is the type.  The @racket[#:contract]
annotation specifies the signature of the relation.

A relation is specifed by a number of clauses.  Each clause has some
number of hypotheses (calls to this or other judgments) and side
conditions (noted with @racket[where]), followed by a line, an
optional name, and a conclusion.  Unlike metafunctions, the clauses
are unordered and therefore may overlap.

Judgments must be ``well-moded''.  If some variable appears in an
output position of a conclusion but cannot be determined based on
inputs or outputs of hypotheses, a static error will be signalled.

Judgments can be used either with the @racket[judgment-holds] form or
from other judgment definitions or metafunctions.  The
@racket[judgment-holds] form works as follows:

@;This prevents us, for example, from leaving off type annotations on
@;@racket[Î»]-bound variables and ``guessing'' them in the type judgment.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(judgment-holds (â¢ () (Î» ([x : num]) x) : (num -> num)))
]

This use specifies a type @racketresult[(num -> num)] and verifies this type
is in the typing relation.

Alternatively, we can use a metavariable in the type position in
order to compute all of the types this term has.  This metavariable is
bound to these types in the scope of the following term which, in this
case is just @racket[T].  Consequently the result is the list of types
for this program.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(judgment-holds (â¢ () (Î» ([x : num]) x) : T) T)
(judgment-holds (â¢ () fact-5 : T) T)
]

It's possible to illustrate judgments as follows:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(eval:alts
(show-derivations
 (build-derivations 
  (â¢ () (Î» ([x : num]) (add1 x)) : T)))
(void))
]

@image[#:suffixes '(".pdf" ".png")]{img/show-derivations}

We can verify that ill-formed lambda-abstractions have no type:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(judgment-holds (â¢ () (Î» ([x : num] [x : num]) x) : T) T)
]

Enough types, let's calculate!

@subsection{The calculus of PCF}

To calculate with PCF programs, we start by formulating a
@deftech{reduction relation} that captures the axioms of reduction for
PCF:

@(redex-eval '(require redex-aam-tutorial/shared))

@; Forward place holder definition
@(redex-eval
'(define-judgment-form PCF
  #:mode (Î´ I O)
  #:contract (Î´ (O N ...) N)
  [(Î´ (+ N_0 N_1) ,(+ (term N_0) (term N_1)))]
  [(Î´ (* N_0 N_1) ,(* (term N_0) (term N_1)))]
  [(Î´ (sub1 N) ,(sub1 (term N)))]
  [(Î´ (add1 N) ,(add1 (term N)))]))

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define r
  (reduction-relation 
   PCF #:domain M
   (--> (Î¼ (X : T) M) 
        (subst (X (Î¼ (X : T) M)) M) 
        Î¼)
     
   (--> ((Î» ([X : T] ...) M_0) M ...)
        (subst (X M) ... M_0)
        Î²)
   
   (--> (O N_0 ...) N_1 
        (judgment-holds (Î´ (O N_0 ...) N_1)) 
        Î´)
   
   (--> (if0 0 M_1 M_2) M_1 if-t)
   (--> (if0 N M_1 M_2) M_2
        (side-condition (not (zero? (term N))))
        if-f)))
]

A reduction relation defines a binary relation on terms in a given
domain, in this case terms @racket[M].  A reduction relation is
defined by a number of clauses, noted with @racket[-->], which consist
of a left-hand side, a right-hand side, any number of side conditions,
and optional name.  The order of clauses is irrelevant and like
judgments, clauses may overlap.

@margin-note{
Even though reduction relations are relations, and conceptually can be
thought of as a judgment with @racket[#:mode (r I O)] and
@racket[#:contract (r M M)], they are considered different from
Redex's point of view and support different operations.}

This definition relies on two auxilary definitions: a @racket[Î´]
relation for interpreting primitive operations and a @racket[subst]
metafunction which implements substitution.  

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-judgment-form PCF
  #:mode (Î´ I O)
  #:contract (Î´ (O N ...) N)
  [(Î´ (+ N_0 N_1) ,(+ (term N_0) (term N_1)))]
  [(Î´ (* N_0 N_1) ,(* (term N_0) (term N_1)))]
  [(Î´ (sub1 N) ,(sub1 (term N)))]
  [(Î´ (add1 N) ,(add1 (term N)))])
]

Note that this judgment omits the horizontal lines, which are in fact
optional (but conclusions precede hypotheses when omitted; of course
it makes no difference when there are no hypotheses as is the case
with @racket[Î´]).  It also uses @racket[unquote], written
``@tt{,}'' to escape out of Redex and into Racket.  Thus the
interpration of PCF's @racketresult[+] is given by Racket's @racket[+]
function, and likewise for the rest of the operations.

The substitution operation is straightforward, if a bit tedious.  We
defer it to an appendix and future models will simply avoid the need
for subsitution.  If you'd like, you can install this package on the
command line: @commandline{$ raco pkg install redex-aam-tutorial} and
then import the @racket[subst] metafunction as follows:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(require redex-aam-tutorial/subst)
(term (subst (x 5) (y 7) (+ x y)))
]


We can now use @racket[apply-reduction-relation] to see the results of
applying the @racket[r] reduction relation to a term:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(apply-reduction-relation r (term (add1 5)))
(apply-reduction-relation r (term ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5))))
(apply-reduction-relation r (term (sub1 ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5)))))
]

The second example shows that @racket[apply-reduction-relation] only
takes @emph{one} step of computation since clearly @racketresult[(add1
5)] can reduce further.  The third example shows that reduction can
only occur at the outermost term; despite having multiple redexes
inside the term, the term itself does not reduce.

Using @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] will take any number of steps
and return the set of irreducible terms:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(apply-reduction-relation* r (term (add1 5)))
(apply-reduction-relation* r (term ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5))))
(apply-reduction-relation* r (term (sub1 ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5)))))
]

Of course, the reflexive, transitive closure of @racket[r], which is
what @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] computes, still does not
enable reductions within terms, so the last example does not reduce.

We could define another reduction relation which incorporates progress
rules.  Alternatively, we can use operations to compute such a
relation from @racket[r]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(compatible-closure r PCF M)
]

This example of the @racket[compatible-closure] operation computes a
new relation that allows @racket[r] to be applied anywhere within a
term @racket[M]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(define -->r (compatible-closure r PCF M))
(apply-reduction-relation* -->r (term ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5))))
(apply-reduction-relation* -->r (term (sub1 ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5)))))
]

It's also possible to visualize each step of reduction using the
@racket[traces] function, which launches a window showing each path of
reduction.  For example:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(eval:alts (traces -->r (term ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5)))) (void))
]

produces:

@image[#:suffixes '(".pdf" ".png") #:scale .8]{img/reduction}

Notice that the @racket[traces] window visualizes all possible
reduction sequences.

@subsection{Call-by-value and call-by-name: Strategies, contexts, and axioms}

It is possible to consider reduction @emph{strategies} which fix a
deterministic order to reductions.  One way to represent such a
strategy is to define a grammar of @deftech{evaluation contexts} that
restrict where the reduction relation @racket[r] may be applied.

For example, to obtain a reduction strategy that always reduces the
left-most, outer-most redex, we can define evaluation context as
follows:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(define-extended-language PCFn PCF
  (E ::= hole 
     (E M ...) 
     (O V ... E M ...)
     (if0 E M M)))
]

Now using @racket[context-closure], we can compute a relation that
does the left-most, outer-most call-by-name reduction.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(define -->n
  (context-closure r PCFn E))
]

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(eval:alts (traces -->n (term ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5)))) (void))
]

@image[#:suffixes '(".pdf" ".png") #:scale .8]{img/cbn-reduction}

Unlike @racket[-->r], we can use @racket[-->n] to calculate
@racket[fact-5]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(apply-reduction-relation* -->n (term fact-5))
]

We can also turn the example into a unit test:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(test-->> -->n (term fact-5) 120)
]

While we can't use @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] to compute
@racket[fact-5] with @racket[-->r], we can test @racket[-->r] with
@racket[test-->>â], which tests for reachability:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(test-->>â -->r (term fact-5) 120)
]



@margin-note{Why doesn't @racket[(apply-reduction-relation* -->r (term
fact-5))] produce an answer?}

In addition to call-by-name, we can also characterize left-most,
outer-most call-by-value reduction with the following strategy and a
restriction of the @racket[Î²] axiom:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(define-extended-language PCFv PCF
  (E ::= hole 
     (V ... E M ...)
     (if0 E M M)))

(define v
  (extend-reduction-relation 
   r PCF #:domain M
   (--> ((Î» ([X : T] ...) M_0) V ...)
        (subst (X V) ... M_0)
        Î²)))

(define -->v
  (context-closure v PCFv E))
]

Notice that @racket[v] is defined as an
@racket[extended-reduction-relation] of @racket[r].  An extension of a
reduction relation can add additional reduction cases or override
existing ones, as is the case here, by providing a new rule with the
same name as an existing one.

Like @racket[-->n], the @racket[-->v] relation defines a deterministic
reduction strategy, but it differs from @racket[-->n] in @emph{where}
it reduces and @emph{what} it reduces:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(eval:alts (traces -->v (term ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5)))) (void))
]

@image[#:suffixes '(".pdf" ".png") #:scale .8]{img/cbv-reduction}

And like @racket[-->n], it produces an answer for @racket[fact-5]:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(apply-reduction-relation* -->v (term fact-5))
]

If the relations @racket[-->n] and @racket[-->v] produce answers, they
are consistent with each other, but the @racket[-->n] relation
produces more answers than @racket[-->v] as the following examples
demonstrate:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval 
(define-term Î©
  ((Î¼ (loop : (num -> num))
      (Î» ([x : num])
        (loop x)))
   0))

(apply-reduction-relation* -->n (term ((Î» ([x : num]) 0) Î©)))
(apply-reduction-relation* -->v (term ((Î» ([x : num]) 0) Î©)))
]

These examples also show that Redex terminates, even when the
reduction of a term has a cycle in it.

@subsection{Evaluation}

As an alternative to the reduction-based approach of the previous
subsection, computation is often characterized by a compositional
evaluation function.  This approach avoids substitution and instead
represents substitutions lazily with a @deftech{closure}, which is a
term paired with an environment mapping variable names to values:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFâ PCF
  (V ::= N O (L Ï) ((Î¼ (X : T) L) Ï))
  (Ï ::= ((X V) ...)))
]

Like type environments, value environments are instances of
association lists, so we will use the generic @racket[lookup] and
@racket[ext] operations.

The evaluation function @racket[â] can now be defined as a judgment as
follows:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-judgment-form PCFâ
  #:mode (â I I I O)
  #:contract (â M Ï : V)
  
  [(â N Ï : N)]  
  [(â O Ï : O)]  
  [(â L Ï : (L Ï))]
  [(â (Î¼ (X_f : T_f) L) Ï : ((Î¼ (X_f : T_f) L) Ï))]
  
  [(lookup Ï X V)
   --------------
   (â X Ï : V)]
  
  [(â M_0 Ï : N)
   (where M ,(if (zero? (term N)) (term M_1) (term M_2)))
   (â M Ï : V)
   ---------------------------
   (â (if0 M_0 M_1 M_2) Ï : V)]
    
  [(â M_0 Ï : O)
   (â M_1 Ï : N)
   ...
   (Î´ (O N ...) N_1)
   -----------------------
   (â (M_0 M_1 ...) Ï : N_1)]
    
  [(â M_0 Ï : ((Î» ([X_1 : T] ...) M) Ï_1))
   (â M_1 Ï : V_1)
   ...
   (â M (ext Ï_1 (X_1 V_1) ...) : V)
   -----------------------------------
   (â (M_0 M_1 ...) Ï : V)]
  
  [(â M_0 Ï : (name f ((Î¼ (X_f : T_f) (Î» ([X_1 : T] ...) M)) Ï_1)))
   (â M_1 Ï : V_1)
   ...
   (â M (ext Ï_1 (X_f f) (X_1 V_1) ...) : V)
   -----------------------------------------
   (â (M_0 M_1 ...) Ï : V)])
]

We can use it to compute examples:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(judgment-holds (â fact-5 () : V) V)
]

Or test:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(test-equal (judgment-holds (â fact-5 () : 120)) #t)
]


@subsection{A brief aside on the caveats of language extensions}

Redex, as we've seen, has some powerful features to support extension,
and this tutorial uses them, well, @emph{extensively}.  However, there
are some gothchas worth being aware of.

One of the most prominent gotchas is the mixing of reduction relation
extensions and metafunctions (or relations).

When a reduction relation is extended, the original relation is
reinterpreted over the new language; thus the original pattern
variables of the original definition may take on new meaning.  So for
example, consider this simple language and reduction relation:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-language L0 (M ::= number))

(define r0 (reduction-relation L0 (--> M 5)))

(apply-reduction-relation r0 (term 7))
]

Suppose we then extend @racket[L0] by overriding the meaning of
@racket[M] to include strings:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language L1 L0 (M ::= .... string))
]

We can create an extension of @racket[r0] that is the reinterpretation
of @racket[r0] over this new meaning of @racket[M]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define r0â² (extend-reduction-relation r0 L1))
]

This works just fine and @racket[r0â²] reduces as expected when applied
to strings:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation r0â² "seven")
]

However, let's consider an alternative, seemingly equivalent
development of the base relation that involves a metafunction:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction L0
  to-five : M -> M
  [(to-five M) 5])

(define r1 (reduction-relation L0 (--> M (to-five M))))

(apply-reduction-relation r1 (term 7))

(define r1â² (extend-reduction-relation r1 L1))
]

You might expect that the extension of @racket[r1] to @racket[L1]
would also reinterpret the definition of @racket[to-five], but it does
not.  Consequently, applying @racket[r1â²] to a string results in a
run-time domain error from applying @racket[to-five] to a string:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation r1â² "seven")
]

Relaxing the contract on @racket[to-five] is no help either; using a
more relaxed contract such as @racket[any -> any] would shift the
error to a failure to match since the @racket[M] in the definition of
@racket[to-five] is still an @racket[M] in @racket[L0] and thus
doesn't match strings.

But isn't there a mechanism for extending metafunctions?  Yes.  There
is @racket[define-metafunction/extension], which allows you to define a
@racket[L1] compatible version of @racket[to-five]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction/extension to-five L1 
  to-five/L1 : M -> M)

(term (to-five/L1 "seven"))
]

This defines a new metafunction, @racket[to-five/L1], which
reinterprets the definition of @racket[to-five] over @racket[L1].  (We
could aslo have added clauses to this definition, which are
conceptually prepended to those of @racket[to-five], but there's no
need in this case.)  However, this has no effect on the original
definition of @racket[to-five], which is what is used within
@racket[r1] @emph{and} its extension @racket[r1â²].  So the problem
remains.

We could have used @racket[to-five/L1] in the original definition of
@racket[r1], but this puts the cart before the horse since we have to
anticipate all extensions before writing the base relation.

We could have named and then overridden this case of the relation in
@racket[r1â²], but this just subverts the original goal of extension,
which is to enable a single point of control; this approach duplicates
code and inflicts all the problems that follow.

The approach we take in this tutorial is to avoid all
language-specific metafunction, relations, and judgments when defining
reduction relations.  We use instead only metafunctions, relations,
and judgments that are either (1) defined only in terms of Redex's
built in patterns (for example, @racket[lookup], @racket[ext], and
@racket[unique]); or (2) defined only for some subset of the language
which doesn't change in extensions (for example, @racket[Î´]).  It is a
compromise, but short of better extension mechanisms in Redex, it
seems to be a reasonable practice.

@subsection{Explicit substitutions}

As an intermediary between the compositional evaluation function based
on value environments and closures and the reduction system based on
substitution, we can also formulate computation as a reduction system
based on environments that is substitution-free.  Such a reduction
semantics is known as an @deftech{explicit substitution} semantics
since the meta-theoretic notion of substitution is represented
explicitly in the system@~cite[bib:explicit].

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFÏ PCFâ
  (C ::= V (M Ï) (if0 C C C) (C C ...))
  (E ::= hole (V ... E C ...) (if0 E C C)))
]

Values are just as in the @racket[PCFâ] language, but closures are
generalized to either terms with environments, or conditionals or
applications with closure sub-terms.  The reduction relation is now
defined on the domain of closures:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define vÏ
  (reduction-relation 
   PCFÏ #:domain C
   (--> ((if0 M ...) Ï) (if0 (M Ï) ...) Ï-if)
   (--> ((M ...) Ï) ((M Ï) ...) Ï-app)
   (--> (O Ï) O Ï-op)
   (--> (N Ï) N Ï-num)        
   (--> (X Ï) V
        (judgment-holds (lookup Ï X V))
        Ï-x)
   
   (--> (((Î» ([X : T] ...) M) Ï) V ...)
        (M (ext Ï (X V) ...))        
        Î²)
   
   (--> ((name f ((Î¼ (X_f : T_f) (Î» ([X : T] ...) M)) Ï)) V ...)
        (M (ext Ï (X_f f) (X V) ...))
        rec-Î²)
   
   (--> (O V ...) V_1
        (judgment-holds (Î´ (O V ...) V_1))
        Î´)
   
   (--> (if0 0 C_1 C_2) C_1 if-t)
   (--> (if0 N C_1 C_2) C_2
        (side-condition (not (equal? 0 (term N))))
        if-f)))
]

The @racket[Ï-if] and @racket[Ï-app] rules distribute environments to
sub-terms of conditionals and applications, respectively.  The
@racket[Ï-op] and @racket[Ï-num] rules drop needless environments from
primitives and numbers.  The @racket[Ï-x] rule looks up the value of a
variable in an environment.  The remaining cases are straightforward
adaptations of the @racket[v] relation to the domain of closures.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define -->vÏ
  (context-closure vÏ PCFÏ E))
]

Let's define a simple injection from terms to closures:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  injÏ : M -> C
  [(injÏ M) (M ())])
]
which we can use to inject programs into initial configurations
before reducing:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ (term (injÏ fact-5)))
]

One of the nice properties of this explicit substitution formulation
is that we don't need a substitution metafunction, which is good since
substitution is both tedious to write and easy to get wrong.

@subsection{Eval/Continue/Apply machine}

Explicit substitutions explicate the handling of variable bindings and
take a principled step from a theoretical calculus toward a realistic
language implementation.  But the @racket[-->vÏ] relation of the
previous section still leaves implicit the process of decomposing a
program into an evaluation context and a redex, then plugging the
contractum back into the context to obtain the new state of the
program.  In this section, we develop a stack machine that makes
explicit the mechanism for finding redexes, thus eliminating the need
for the @racket[context-closure] operation.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFÏ PCFÏ
  (F ::= (V ... [] C ...) (if0 [] C C))
  (K ::= (F ...))
  (S ::= @code:comment{serious terms S â© V = â, C = S âª V}
     (N Ï)
     (O Ï)
     (X Ï)
     ((M M ...) Ï)
     ((if0 M M M) Ï)
     (if0 C C C)
     (C C ...))
  (Ï ::= (C K) V))
]

We start by formulating a representation of the context.  An
evaluation context will be represented as a @deftech{continuation}: a
list of @deftech{frame}s, where a frame is a single flat evaluation
context, i.e. either a conditional or application context with no
nested evaluation context inside (the hole will be represented by
@racketresult[[]]).  Conceptually, the continuation is a stack of
actions that remain to be done.  It's also easy to see that
continuations and evaluation contexts are inter-convertible: the
inner-most part of an evaluation context is the first frame of a
continuation; the outer-most part of the context corresponds to the
final frame of a continuation; an empty context is represented by an
empty list of frames.


Computation is defined over the domain of @emph{states}, which are
closures paired with a continuation; the final state of a computation
is just a value.


The transitions of this machine break down into three categories:
@emph{apply} transitions, which actually perform closure reduction;
@emph{eval} transitions, which push actions on to the continuation;
and @emph{continue} transitions which pop actions of the continuation
and search for the next redex.

In order to determine when a frame should be pushed on the stack, we
define a category of @deftech{serious} terms @racket[S], which are
non-value closures.  If a conditional or application contains a
serious term, a frame is pushed.  If the closure component of the
state is a value, the top frame is popped and the value is plugged
into its hole; if the stack is empty, the value is the final result of
the computation.  If the closure component is a redex, it is reduced
using @racket[vÏ].

The apply transitions are obtained by lifting @racket[vÏ] to operate
on states; here we use the @racket[(context-closure vÏ PCFÏ (hole K))]
to obtain this relation.  The eval and continue transitions are
straightforward and make explicit as reductions what
@racket[context-closure] computes.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define -->vÏ
  (extend-reduction-relation
   @code:comment{Apply}
   (context-closure vÏ PCFÏ (hole K))
   PCFÏ
   @code:comment{Eval}
   (--> ((if0 S_0 C_1 C_2) (F ...))
        (S_0 ((if0 [] C_1 C_2) F ...)) 
        ev-if)
   
   (--> ((V ... S C ...) (F ...))
        (S ((V ... [] C ...) F ...))
        ev-app)
   
   @code:comment{Continue}
   (--> (V ()) V halt)
   
   (--> (V ((if0 [] C_1 C_2) F ...))
        ((if0 V C_1 C_2) (F ...)) 
        co-if)
   
   (--> (V ((V_0 ... [] C_0 ...) F ...))
        ((V_0 ... V C_0 ...) (F ...))
        co-app)))
]

Again, we define an injection into initial configurations:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  injÏ : M -> Ï
  [(injÏ M) ((injÏ M) ())])
]

We can verify the machine computes the expected results:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ (term (injÏ fact-5)))
]

If we examine the reduction graph for a program, what we see is that
the graph for a @racket[-->vÏ] computation is just like @racket[-->vÏ]
computation, but with more transitions corresponding to the
decomposition and recomposition of programs into evaluation contexts
and redexes.  

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(eval:alts (traces -->vÏ (term (injÏ ((Î» ([x : num]) x) (add1 5))))) (void))
]

@image[#:suffixes '(".pdf" ".png")]{img/machine-reduction}


@subsection{Heap-allocated bindings}

In order to model imperative features such as references, arrays, or
mutable variables---or even just to give an object-level account of
memory allocation, rather than an implicit meta-level account---we
need to incorporate a @deftech{heap}, a mapping from addresses (or
pointers, or locations, etc.) to values.  Our language doesn't have
any imperative features, however as we'll see using a heap-based
machine model is an important component of the AAM approach to
constructing analyses.  We will now add a heap and use it to account
for the memory used to bind variables when a function is applied.

In this model, we create a level of indirection in variable bindings
so that environments will now map from variable names to addresses and
the heap will resolve these addresses to values.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFÏ PCFÏ
  (Ï ::= ((X A) ...))  
  (Î£ ::= ((A V) ...))
  (A ::= any)
  (Ï ::= (Ï Î£) V))
]

The reduction relation @racket[-->vÏ] will consist of @racket[-->vÏ],
lifted to operate within the context @racket[(hole Î£)], but then
overriding the variable binding and dereference rules to allocate and
dereference bindings via the heap:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define -->vÏ
  (extend-reduction-relation
   (context-closure -->vÏ PCFÏ (hole Î£))
   PCFÏ
   (--> (N Î£) N discard-Î£-N)
   (--> (O Î£) O discard-Î£-O)
   (--> (((X Ï) K) Î£) ((V K) Î£) 
        (judgment-holds (lookup Ï X A))
        (judgment-holds (lookup Î£ A V))
        Ï-x)
    
   (--> (name Ï (((((Î» ([X : T] ...) M) Ï) V ...) K) Î£))
        (((M (ext Ï (X A) ...)) K) (ext Î£ (A V) ...))
        (where (A ...) (alloc Ï))
        Î²)
    
   (--> (name Ï ((((name f ((Î¼ (X_f : T_f) (Î» ([X : T] ...) M)) Ï)) V ...) K) Î£))
        (((M (ext Ï (X_f A_f) (X A) ...)) K) (ext Î£ (A_f f) (A V) ...))
        (where (A_f A ...) (alloc Ï))
        rec-Î²)))
]

We've also added two rules for discarding the heap for final states
that consist of numbers or primitive operations since the heap is
irrelevant.  For function results though, we'll need to keep the heap
to make sense of any environments inside the result.

As usual, we give an injection function:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  injÏ : M -> Ï
  [(injÏ M) ((injÏ M) ())])
]

The @racket[-->vÏ] relation relies on a helper metafunction
@racket[alloc], which allocates address for variables bindings.
First, we define a metafunction for extracting formal parameter names:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  formals : M -> (X ...)
  [(formals (Î» ([X : T] ...) M)) (X ...)]
  [(formals (Î¼ (X_f : T_f) L)) (X_f X ...)
   (where (X ...) (formals L))])
]

The @racket[alloc] metafunction consumes a state representing a
@racket[Î²] or @racket[rec-Î²] redex and it produces a fresh address for
each formal parameter name:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  alloc : ((C K) Î£) -> (A ...)
  [(alloc ((((M Ï) V ...) K) Î£))
   ,(map (Î» (x) (list x (gensym x)))
         (term (formals M)))])
]

@margin-note{A transgression has just occurred.  Can you spot it?}

For example:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term (alloc (((((Î» ([y : num] [z : num]) y) ()) 5 7) ()) ())))
]

Note that addresses have some structure under this allocation
strategy; an address is a 2-element list consisting of the variable
name being bound followed by a unique symbol for this particular
binding.  Only the latter symbol is needed to guarantee freshness, but
as well see, this strategy is useful to relate concrete and
approximating machines.

When a redex is contracted, we see the bindings in the heap:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation -->vÏ
  (term (((((Î» ([y : num] [z : num]) y) ()) 5 7) ()) ())))
]

Finally, we can verify the heap-based semantics remains faithful to
previous semantics and computes the correct result for
@racket[fact-5]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ (term (injÏ fact-5)))
]

It's easy to see that from an initial configuration @racket[-->vÏ]
reduction operates in lock-step with @racket[-->vÏ] reduction (modulo
the possibility of a final @racket[discard-Î£] step and some
``stuttering'' steps).

@exercise["asdf"]{Formulate and test an equivalence invariant between
@racket[-->vÏ] and @racket[-->vÏ].}

@subsection{Abstracting over @racket[alloc]}

In the previous section, we broke one of our design principles: we
wrote a reduction relation that relies on a language-specific
metafunction, namely @racket[alloc].

We could try to rewrite @racket[alloc] to be language independent, but
it's not clear this will work in the long-run.  Unlike @racket[lookup]
and @racket[ext], the @racket[alloc] metafunction is fundamentally
tied to the @racket[PCFÏ] language.

In this section, we explore another option for writing extensible
reduction relations that depend on language-specific metafunctions: we
abstract over these metafunctions.

The problem with abstracting over a metafunction is that a
metafunction is not a value.  So we can't use functional abstraction
and pass in @racket[alloc] as a parameter to a function that returns a
reduction relation, i.e. the following won't work:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]{
#lang racket
(define (-->vÏ/alloc alloc) Â«RHS of -->vÏ definitionÂ»)

;; recreate original definition:
(define -->vÏ (-->vÏ/alloc alloc))
}

Luckily, Racket includes mechanisms for @emph{syntactic abstraction},
enabling abstraction over syntax, which is exactly what is needed
here.  So we solve our problem by creating a syntactic shorthand as
follows:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]{
#lang racket
(define-syntax-rule (-->vÏ/alloc alloc) Â«RHS of -->vÏ definitionÂ»)

;; recreate original definition:
(define -->vÏ (-->vÏ/alloc alloc))
}

This definition tells Racket to syntactically replace any occurrences
of @racket[(-->vÏ/alloc E)] with the RHS code, substitution @racket[E]
for occurrences of the name @racket[alloc], where @racket[E] may be an
arbitrary piece of syntax.

There is just one minor snag: Racket's @racket[define-syntax-rule]
mechanism has its own use of @racket[...], which conflicts with the
occurrences of @racket[...] in the definition of @racket[-->vÏ].  To
side-step the issue, we just need to quote the ellipses of the
definition, indicating that they should be treated literally and not
interpreted as @racket[define-syntax-rule]'s ellipsis.  To accomplish
this, we do the following:

@codeblock[#:keep-lang-line? #f]{
#lang racket
(define-syntax-rule (-->vÏ/alloc alloc) (... Â«RHS of -->vÏ definitionÂ»))
}

The full code is now:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-syntax-rule (-->vÏ/alloc alloc)
  (...
   (extend-reduction-relation
    (context-closure -->vÏ PCFÏ (hole Î£))
    PCFÏ
    (--> (N Î£) N discard-Î£-N)
    (--> (O Î£) O discard-Î£-O)
    (--> (((X Ï) K) Î£) ((V K) Î£) 
         (judgment-holds (lookup Ï X A))
         (judgment-holds (lookup Î£ A V))
         Ï-x)
    
    (--> (name Ï (((((Î» ([X : T] ...) M) Ï) V ...) K) Î£))
         (((M (ext Ï (X A) ...)) K) (ext Î£ (A V) ...))
         (where (A ...) (alloc Ï))
         Î²)
    
    (--> (name Ï ((((name f ((Î¼ (X_f : T_f) (Î» ([X : T] ...) M)) Ï)) V ...) K) Î£))
         (((M (ext Ï (X_f A_f) (X A) ...)) K) (ext Î£ (A_f f) (A V) ...))
         (where (A_f A ...) (alloc Ï))
         rec-Î²))))

@code:comment{recreate original definition:}
(define -->vÏ (-->vÏ/alloc alloc))
]

We can re-verify the relation works as expected:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ (term (injÏ fact-5)))
]

Of course, now we can experiment with different allocation strategies,
such as one that generates fresh symbols, or another that uses the
smallest available natural number:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  alloc-gensym : ((C K) Î£) -> (A ...)
  [(alloc-gensym ((((M Ï) V ...) K) Î£))
   ,(map gensym (term (formals M)))])

(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  alloc-nat : ((C K) Î£) -> (A ...)
  [(alloc-nat ((((M Ï) V ...) K) ((A _) ...)))
   ,(let ((n (add1 (apply max 0 (term (A ...))))))
      (build-list (length (term (formals M)))
                  (Î» (i) (+ i n))))])

(test-->> (-->vÏ/alloc alloc-gensym)
          (term (injÏ fact-5))
          120)

(test-->> (-->vÏ/alloc alloc-nat)
          (term (injÏ fact-5))
          120)
]

For any allocation function @racket[_alloc], so long as
@racket[(_alloc Ï)] produces an address not in @racket[Ï], then
@racket[(-->vÏ/alloc _alloc)] computes the same reduction as
@racket[-->vÏ/alloc]---up to the choice of addresses---using any other
allocation function that similarly produces fresh names.


@subsection{Heap-allocated continuations}

Just as bindings can be allocated in the heap, so too can
continuations.  In this section, we develop a variant of the previous
semantics that abandons the stack model, instead modelling the
continuation as a linked-list structure allocated in the heap.

There are several practical reasons one might want to do this; for
example, this is the implementation strategy of many languages
supporting first-class continuations.  However, as we'll see, this is
another step relevant to the AAM approach for constructing finite
models of programs.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFÏ* PCFÏ
  (K ::= () (F A))
  (Î£ ::= ((A U) ...))
  (U ::= V K))
]

The @racket[PCFÏ*] overrides the grammar of continuations in the
@racket[PCFÏ] language.  A continuation is now either empty or a
single frame with a pointer to the rest of the continuation.  Heaps
are extended to associated addresses to either values or
continuations.

The reduction relation @racket[-->vÏ*] is just like @racket[-->vÏ]
except that it 
@itemlist[
@item{replaces the eval transitions with alternatives that
allocate frames in the heap instead of pushing on the stack, and}

@item{replaces the continue transitions with alternatives that
dereference the current frame pointer and install a new continuation
instead of popping the stack.}
]

Because we need to allocate continuation pointers, an extension of
@racket[alloc] is required:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction/extension alloc PCFÏ* 
  alloc* : ((C K) Î£) -> (A ...)
  [(alloc* (((if0 S_0 C_1 C_2) K) Î£))
   (((if0 [] C_1 C_2) ,(gensym 'if0)))]
  [(alloc* (((V ... S C ...) K) Î£))
   (((V ... [] C ...) ,(gensym 'app)))])
]

This allocation strategy is designed in a way similar to
@racket[alloc]: given a configuration that is about to make a continue
transition, it produces a two element list, the first element is the
frame for which we are allocating, the second is a unique symbol.
Only the second component is necessary, but the first is helpful for
making sense of what's going on.

Some examples:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term (alloc* (((if0 ((add1 2) ()) (3 ()) (4 ())) ()) ())))

(term (alloc* (((((Î» ((y : num)) y) ()) ((add1 2) ())) ()) ())))
]

The @racket[alloc*] metafunction is an extension of @racket[alloc], so
it behaves just like @racket[alloc] on @racket[Î²] and @racket[rec-Î²]
redex configurations:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(term (alloc* (((((Î» ([y : num] [z : num]) y) ()) 5 7) ()) ())))
]

Now, because we have overridden the meaning of states, we really want
to compute an extension, not of @racket[-->vÏ], but of @racket[-->vÏ]
@emph{using} @racket[alloc*]; otherwise there will be failure to match errors
because of the mismatch between @racket[alloc] and @racket[PCFÏ*].  In
other words, we want to compute an extension of @racket[(-->vÏ/alloc
alloc*)].  And because we're likely to want to extend @racket[-->vÏ*]
further, we similarly abstract over the allocation metafunction again
using @racket[define-syntax-rule], thus arriving at the following code:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-syntax-rule
  (-->vÏ*/alloc alloc*)
  (...
   (extend-reduction-relation
    (-->vÏ/alloc alloc*) 
    PCFÏ*
    @code:comment{Eval}
    (--> (name Ï (((if0 S_0 C_1 C_2) K) Î£))
         ((S_0 ((if0 [] C_1 C_2) A)) (ext Î£ (A K)))
         (where (A) (alloc* Ï))        
         ev-if)
    
    (--> (name Ï (((V ... S C ...) K) Î£))
         ((S ((V ... [] C ...) A)) (ext Î£ (A K)))
         (where (A) (alloc* Ï))
         ev-app)
    
    @code:comment{Continue}
    (--> ((V ((if0 [] C_1 C_2) A)) Î£)
         (((if0 V C_1 C_2) K) Î£)
         (judgment-holds (lookup Î£ A K))
         co-if)
    
    (--> ((V ((V_0 ... [] C_0 ...) A)) Î£)
         (((V_0 ... V C_0 ...) K) Î£)
         (judgment-holds (lookup Î£ A K))
         co-app))))

(define -->vÏ* (-->vÏ*/alloc alloc*))
]

And now we can verify the running example yet again:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ* (term (injÏ fact-5)))
]

It's straightforward to observe that @racket[-->vÏ*] and
@racket[-->vÏ] operate in lock-step starting the same initial
configuration.

between @racket[-->vÏ*] and @racket[-->vÏ].}

@subsection{A look back; a look forward}

We've now developed a number of semantic artifacts for the
@racket[PCF] language.  We've seen a calculus, a type judgment, a
compositional evaluation function, a left-to-right call-by-value
reduction semantics phrased in terms of substitution and evaluation
contexts, then as a calculus of explicit substitutions, and later as a
series of related abstract machines that model computation at a lower
and lower level, concluding with a heap-based machine that allocates
bindings and continuations.

While the path taken has anticipated the upcoming AAM steps, we have
tread a well-worn path from high-level semantics to low-level machines
using only standard semantics engineering steps.  In other words,
everything we've done so far should be accessible to anyone with basic
training in programming language syntax and semantics. A PhD in static
analysis has not proved necessary.  And this is the point of AAM: to
close the gap between semantics and analysis so that deep training and
specialization in static analysis is not needed.  Instead, if you can
understand a language semantics, you should be able to construct a
program analyzer.  Moreover, you should be able to import ideas from
the interpretation of programs into the analysis of programs
@emph{tout de suite}.

@section{Approximating interpretation}

Program analysis is the science of predicting program behavior.  If
you open almost any classic textbook on the subject, you'll find
descriptions such as this (emphasis added):

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@italic{
[Program] analysis is a tool for discovering properties of the
run-time behavior of a program @bold{without actually running it}@~cite[bib:muchnick-jones].
}}

This is partly on the mark: program analysis is about discovering what
happens when a program is run.  Exactly what we want to discover
depends on the particular application we have in mind.  Perhaps we
want to know if the program causes an error, or leaks your contacts to
spammers, or whether a particular piece of code is dead, or to which
arguments are a particular function applied, etc.

But why should we do this @italic{@bold{without}} running the program?
Isn't that the most straightforward way to discover such properties?

Well, there are a number of problems with just running a program; two
prominent ones are (1) maybe it doesn't terminate, and (2) maybe we
want to consider @emph{all} possible executions of a program, not just one.

These problems have motivated long and varied lines of research in
ways of discovering program properties through means other than
running programs.  Examples include constraint-based analysis, the
monotone data-flow analysis framework, type inference systems (often
formulated in terms of constraint systems), and many more.  The common
theme to this approaches is to take programs and map them into some
alternative domain, usually losing some information, and then reason
about them in that setting, totally detached from notions of ``running
the program.'' 

For example, one approach to discovering if an untyped program does
not have the property ``causes a run-time type-error,'' we could
design a language of types; define a typing relation between programs
and types; prove soundness of the relation, meaning programs in the
relation do not cause run-time errors; since in most cases the typing
relation will not be algorithmic, define a language of type
constraints and a mapping from programs to type constraints; design a
resolution method for solving type constraints and prove it complete
(or maybe not).  All this, only to discover many programs can't be
proved safe this way, so refine the type system, rinse and repeat.

And despite all the hard work invested in getting away from evaluation
and into some other domain (but then @emph{post-facto} establishing a
connection because, after all, we're trying to predict something about
evaluation), in the end what are you computing other than an indirect,
encoded, and approximate variation of evaluation?  This is why Patrick
and Radhia Cousot have been so successful in showing every kind of
program analysis under the sun is a kind of @emph{abstract}
interpretation.  What else could it be?

So if program analysis, however disguised, is computing something
similar to the interpreter of a language, why can't we design program
analyzers to look more like interpreters?  Why can't we leverage what
we know about building interpreters to build analyzers?  And why can't
we make program analyzers that are obviously correct by avoiding the
errors and effort that come with navigating a significant departure
from the running of programs.

But what about the problems of termination, etc.?  Yes, these still
exist, but we can attack them directly.  In this part of the tutorial,
we'll see how to take an interpreter, in the form of abstract machine,
and turn it into another machine that is a sound and computable
approximation of the interpreter.  This @emph{abstract} abstract
machine will always terminate and always give sound predictions for
all possible executions of the program.

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@italic{
We will discover properties of the run-time behavior of a program
@bold{by actually running it (approximately).}}}

@subsection{Abstracting over @racket[Î£]}

With @racket[PCFÏ*], we had a machine with heap-bound bindings and
continuations.  One of the key mechanisms for turning a concrete
semantics into a computable, approximating semantics is to bound the
size of this heap.  As we'll see, doing this requires using a different
notion of a heap (an ``abstract'' heap).

So our next step will be an abstraction of the @racket[PCFÏ*] machine
to factor out the signature of heaps as an abstract data type.  We do
this by a syntactic abstraction over the signature of heaps, namely
the @racket[ext] and @racket[lookup] operations (recall that we've
already abstracted over allocations functions).

To start, we have to go back to @racket[-->vÏ] and abstract it as
follows:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-syntax-rule (-->vÏ/Î£ alloc ext-Î£ lookup-Î£)
  (...
   (extend-reduction-relation
    (context-closure -->vÏ PCFÏ (hole Î£))
    PCFÏ
    (--> (N Î£) N discard-Î£-N)
    (--> (O Î£) O discard-Î£-O)
    (--> (((X Ï) K) Î£) ((V K) Î£) 
         (judgment-holds (lookup Ï X A))
         (judgment-holds (lookup-Î£ Î£ A V))
         Ï-x)
    
    (--> (name Ï (((((Î» ([X : T] ...) M) Ï) V ...) K) Î£))
         (((M (ext Ï (X A) ...)) K) (ext-Î£ Î£ (A V) ...))
         (where (A ...) (alloc Ï))
         Î²)
    
    (--> (name Ï ((((name f ((Î¼ (X_f : T_f) (Î» ([X : T] ...) M)) Ï)) V ...) K) Î£))
         (((M (ext Ï (X_f A_f) (X A) ...)) K) (ext-Î£ Î£ (A_f f) (A V) ...))
         (where (A_f A ...) (alloc Ï))
         rec-Î²))))
]


It's easy to recreate and test our previous relations and abstractions:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-syntax-rule 
  (-->vÏ/alloc alloc)
  (-->vÏ/Î£ alloc ext lookup))

(define -->vÏ (-->vÏ/alloc alloc))

(test-->> -->vÏ (term (injÏ fact-5)) 120)
]

Next, we abstract @racket[-->vÏ*]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-syntax-rule
  (-->vÏ*/Î£ alloc* ext-Î£ lookup-Î£)
  (...
   (extend-reduction-relation
    (-->vÏ/Î£ alloc* ext-Î£ lookup-Î£)
    PCFÏ*
    @code:comment{Eval}
    (--> (name Ï (((if0 S_0 C_1 C_2) K) Î£))
         ((S_0 ((if0 [] C_1 C_2) A)) (ext-Î£ Î£ (A K)))
         (where (A) (alloc* Ï))        
         ev-if)
    
    (--> (name Ï (((V ... S C ...) K) Î£))
         ((S ((V ... [] C ...) A)) (ext-Î£ Î£ (A K)))
         (where (A) (alloc* Ï))
         ev-app)
    
    @code:comment{Continue}
    (--> ((V ((if0 [] C_1 C_2) A)) Î£)
         (((if0 V C_1 C_2) K) Î£)
         (judgment-holds (lookup-Î£ Î£ A K))
         co-if)
    
    (--> ((V ((V_0 ... [] C_0 ...) A)) Î£)
         (((V_0 ... V C_0 ...) K) Î£)
         (judgment-holds (lookup-Î£ Î£ A K))
         co-app))))
]

And recreate and test:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-syntax-rule
  (-->vÏ*/alloc alloc*)
  (-->vÏ*/Î£ alloc* ext lookup))

(define -->vÏ* (-->vÏ*/alloc alloc*))

(test-->> -->vÏ* (term (injÏ fact-5)) 120)
]

@subsection{Set-based heap}

It's now easy to construct new implementations of heaps and use them
to define new relations.  For example, here is an implementation that
models a heap as a Racket hash table that maps keys to @emph{sets} of
values.

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-judgment-form REDEX
  #:mode (lookup-Î£ I I O)
  #:contract (lookup-Î£ any_r any_k any_v)
  [(lookup-Î£ any_r any_k any_v)
   (where (_ ... any_v _ ...)
          ,(set->list
            (hash-ref (term any_r)
                      (term any_k)
		      '())))])

(define-metafunction REDEX
  ext-Î£1 : any (any any) -> any
  [(ext-Î£1 any_r (any_k any_v))
   ,(hash-set (term any_r)
              (term any_k)
              (set-add (hash-ref (term any_r) (term any_k) (set))
                       (term any_v)))])

(define-metafunction REDEX
  ext-Î£ : any (any any) ... -> any
  [(ext-Î£ any_r) any_r]
  [(ext-Î£ any_r any_kv0 any_kv1 ...)
   (ext-Î£ (ext-Î£1 any_r any_kv0) any_kv1 ...)])

(define-term Î£â ,(hash))
]

We have to extend the @racket[PCFÏ*] language to reflect our change in
the representation of heaps:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFÏâ PCFÏ*
  (Î£ ::= any))

(define-syntax-rule (-->vÏâ/Î£ alloc ext-Î£ lookup-Î£)
  (extend-reduction-relation
   (-->vÏ*/Î£ alloc ext-Î£ lookup-Î£) 
   PCFÏâ))

(define-metafunction/extension alloc* PCFÏâ
  allocâ : Ï -> (A ...))]

Finally, we define @racket[-->vÏâ]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define -->vÏâ (-->vÏâ/Î£ allocâ ext-Î£ lookup-Î£))

(define-metafunction PCFÏâ
  injÏâ : M -> Ï
  [(injÏâ M) ((injÏ M) Î£â)])

(test-->> -->vÏâ (term (injÏâ fact-5)) 120)
]

It's important to note that @racket[-->vÏâ] computes exactly what
@racket[-->vÏ*] does, just with a different representation.  Everwhere
that you see a heap binding @racketresult[x] to @racketresult[v], in
the @racket[PCFÏ*] state, you'll see an association @racketresult[(x
v)], whereas in the @racket[PCFÏâ] state, you'll see a hash table
mapping @racketresult[x] to the singleton set containing
@racketresult[v].

@subsection{Make it finite}

One way to make the interpretation of a program computable is to make
the space of program states finite.  Think about this way, when
@racket[-->vÏ*] (or equivalently, @racket[-->vÏâ]) runs forever
interpreting a program, it must be exploring an infinite subset of the
domain @racket[Ï*].  We could design an approximation of
@racket[-->vÏ*] that operates on a finite approximation of
@racket[Ï*].  If the approximation of @racket[Ï*] is finite, there's
no way a program can run forever since there is no infinite subset of
the finite approximation of @racket[Ï*].

In this section, we'll develop such a finite approximation.

First, let's reflect how the running of a program could explore an
infinite subset of @racket[Ï*].  There are only two ways, in fact: it
could allocate an unbounded amount of memory, it could compute an
arbitrarily large number.  So to bound the running of a program, we
need only bound its memory and its numbers.

This is one of the advantage of @racket[PCFÏ*], and indeed why it was
designed as such.  The other languages have more sources of unbounded
behavior: a @racket[PCFÏ] program could grow the stack without bound,
a @racket[PCFÏ] program could create an unbounded number of closures,
and a @racket[PCF] program could create an unbounded number of terms
that don't appear in the source program due to substitution.  In
contrast, every stack frame and closure is accounted for in the heap
of a @racket[PCFÏ*] program.  With the exception of numbers, no
expression ever arises in the running of a program that doesn't exist
in the source of the program.

So to tame @racket[PCFÏ*] programs, we must tame numbers and memory.
Let's tackle numbers first.  How could a @racket[PCFÏ*] program
generate an infinite number of numbers?  Only by an unbounded number
of applications of primitive operations.  Let's introduce an
abstraction of numbers.  We'll use a particularly coarse abstraction
here, but any sound, finite abstraction would work (e.g. we could use
a domain of signs).  Here is our abstraction:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-extended-language PCFÏ^ PCFÏâ
  (N ::= .... num))
]

That is, we extend the set of numbers to include a new number called
@racket[num], which should be interpreted as representing @emph{any}
number.  Having introduced this abstraction, we now provide an
alternative interpretation of primitive operations that always
produces @racket[num]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-judgment-form PCFÏ^
  #:mode (Î´^ I O)
  #:contract (Î´^ (O N ...) N)
  [(Î´^ (O N_0 N_1) num)]
  [(Î´^ (O N) num)])
]


Moving on to the taming memory, we will replace the allocation
function with an alternative that only produces a @emph{finite} set of
addresses.  We could choose any strategy for finitizing the allocation
function, and the particular strategy you choose will have major
consequences for the program analysis you construct.  One simple
method for finitizing allocation is to @emph{truncate} the results of
@racket[allocâ] to a single symbol.  In the case of variable bindings
this symbol will just be the name of the variable.  Consequently, the
approximation we compute will be what's known as a
@deftech{monovariant} analysis:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction/extension allocâ PCFÏ^
  allocâ^ : ((C K) Î£) -> (A ...))

(define-metafunction PCFÏ^
  alloc^ : ((C K) Î£) -> (A ...)
  [(alloc^ Ï)
   (A ...)
   (where ((A _) ...) (allocâ^ Ï))])
]


Besides primitive operations, there's one other consumer of numbers:
the conditional form @racket[if0].  We want to design the semantics of
@racket[if0] in combination with the abstraction @racket[num] so that
it covers all behavior abstracted by @racket[num].  Since a number may
be zero or non-zero, we add cases to the reduction relation to take
both branches when a conditional encounters @racket[num]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define -->vÏ^ 
  (extend-reduction-relation
   (-->vÏâ/Î£ alloc^ ext-Î£ lookup-Î£)
   PCFÏ^
   (--> (((O N ...) K) Î£)
        ((N_1 K) Î£)
        (judgment-holds (Î´^ (O N ...) N_1))
        Î´)
   (--> (((if0 num C_1 C_2) K) Î£)
        ((C_1 K) Î£)
        if0-num-t)
   (--> (((if0 num C_1 C_2) K) Î£)
        ((C_2 K) Î£)
        if0-num-f)))
]

Notice that now the reduction relation is truly a relation and not a
function; some terms have multiple successors:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ^ (term (injÏâ (if0 (add1 0) 1 2))))]


Now when we abstractly run our example, we see that results include
@racket[num]:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ^ (term (injÏâ fact-5)))
]

Here's another example that shows the approximation in bindings.
Notice that @racket[_z] is bound to both @racket[0] and @racket[1], so
both are given as possible results for this program:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* 
 -->vÏ^
 (term (injÏâ ((Î» ([f : (num -> num)])
                 ((Î» ([_ : num]) (f 0)) (f 1)))
               (Î» ([z : num]) z)))))
]

Here's an example where we can see that @racketresult[Î©] does not
terminate; thus the analysis proves non-termination for this program:
@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ^ (term (injÏâ Î©)))
]

@exercise["approx"]{Develop an ``approximation'' relation between
concrete states (@racket[PCFÏâ]) and abstract states (@racket[PCFÏ^])
and then formulate and test an invariant that states any concrete
reduction implies the existence of a abstract reduction.}

@subsection{Soundness}

We have aimed to construct a new semantics (@racket[-->vÏ^]) that is a
@emph{sound} and @emph{computable} approximation of the original
abstract machine semantics (@racket[-->vÏâ]).  The computability
argument is simple: starting from an initial configuration, there are
only a finite set of states that can be reached.  You can check this
yourself by going through each category of the state space to observe
that there are only a finite number of elements, assuming the
@racket[alloc^] function only returns elements drawn from a finite
set.

The soundness argument is also simple: every time the concrete machine
@racket[-->vÏâ] takes a step from one state @racket[_Ï_1] to
@racket[_Ï_2], then starting from a corresponding abstract state that
approximates @racket[_Ï_1], the @racket[-->vÏ^] machine steps to a
state that approximates @racket[_Ï_2].  It may also step to other
states---such is the nature of approximation---but at least one of the
successor states will be an approximation of the ``real'' successor.
Consequently, while the concrete machines reduction may produce an
infinite trace of states, that infinite trace will follow a path
through the finite graph of the abstract reduction graph.

We can formalize this observation by first defining what it means for
a concrete state to be approximated by an abstract one.  We do so with
a relation, @racket[âÏ], which relates concrete and abstract states:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-relation PCFÏ^
  âÏ â Ï Ã Ï
  [(âÏ V_1 V_2)
   (âV V_1 V_2)]  
  [(âÏ (Ï_1 Î£_1) (Ï_2 Î£_2))
   (âÏ Ï_1 Ï_2)
   (âÎ£ Î£_1 Î£_2)])
]

As you can see, this depends on notions of approximation for each
sub-component of a machine state.  The remaining definitions are
straightforward by structural recursion, with the exception of 
values, addresses, environments, and stores.

Approximation for values is simple; the interesting case is the base
case that takes of abstract values @racket[num].

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-relation PCFÏ^
  âV â V Ã V
  [(âV N num)]
  [(âV N N)]
  [(âV O O)]
  [(âV (L Ï_1) (L Ï_2))
   (âÏ Ï_1 Ï_2)]  
  [(âV ((Î¼ (X : T) L) Ï_1)
       ((Î¼ (X : T) L) Ï_2))
   (âÏ Ï_1 Ï_2)])      
]

Approximation for addresses follows from our choice of @racket[alloc*]
and @racket[alloc^]:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-relation PCFÏ^
  âA â A Ã A
  [(âA (X any) X)]
  [(âA (F_1 any) F_2)
   (âF F_1 F_2)])
]

Notice that a concrete address is approximated by an abstract one if
truncating the unique part of a concrete address obtains the abstract
counterpart.

Environments, which are finite maps, are defined by the usual notion
of inclusion for maps, combined with approximation in the range:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
;; for every x â dom(Ï_1)
;; if Ï_1(x) = a then
;; Ï_2(x) = a^ and a â a^ 
(define-relation PCFÏ^
  âÏ â Ï Ã Ï
  [(âÏ () Ï)]
  [(âÏ ((X_0 A_0) (X_1 A_1) ...)
       (name Ï (_ ... (X_0 A_2) _ ...)))
   (âA A_0 A_2)
   (âÏ ((X_1 A_1) ...) Ï)])
]

This gives a clue as to how to define approximation for stores, too,
but with two added complications: approximation must be used in the
domain as well as the range and we have used a non-s-expression based
representation.  The later means we cannot use Redex's pattern
matching language to define the relation and instead escape to Racket:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-relation PCFÏ^
  âÎ£ â Î£ Ã Î£
  [(âÎ£ Î£_1 Î£_2)
   (where #t
	  ,(for/and ([(a us) (in-hash (term Î£_1))])
	     (for/and ([u (in-set us)])
	       (for/or ([(a^ us^) (in-hash (term Î£_2))])
	         (for/or ([u^ (in-set us^)])
		   (and (term (âA ,a ,a^))
                        (term (âU ,u ,u^))))))))])
]



@subsection{Discovering properties}

At this point, we have a sound and computable approximation to the
machine semantics for PCF.  Since we know the machine semantics
corresponds with all the earlier higher-level semantics, we have a
computable approximation to them as well.  But what can we do with
such a thing?

In general, program analysis is concerned with making sound
predictions about what can happen at run-time, and we are now in a
position to make such predictions.  The way to think about these
predictions is to think of the (finite) graph generated by the
iterated application of @racket[-->vÏ^].  Each state of this machine
stands for a set (which is potentially an infinite set) of
``concrete'' machine states.

If a concrete machine state is not ``stood for'' in the abstract
graph, then it cannot be reached when the program is run.  We saw a
simple example of this earlier: the program @racket[_Î©] never reaches
a final value state in the abstract, therefore we can conclude that it
never finishes when concretely run either.

By looking at the abstract semantics of @racket[(term fact-5)] we can
conclude that if it produces a value, it produces a number.  This is
confirming a fact implied by the type of the program.  Suppose we were
instead dealing with an untyped language, this analysis would have
proven the run-time type safety of the program.

We can confirm this by running (an ill-typed) program and seeing that
there are stuck states in the abstract trace.  Here's a variant of the
factorial program that produces a function in the base case instead of
a number:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-term fact-5-bug
  ((Î¼ (fact : (num -> num))
     (Î» ([n : num])
       (if0 n
            add1
            (* n (fact (sub1 n))))))
   5))

(define (final-states ss)
  (set->list
    (list->set 
      (map (term-match/single PCFÏ^
             [((C K) Î£) (term C)]
             [V (term V)])
           ss))))

(final-states
  (apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ^ (term (injÏâ fact-5-bug))))
]

Here we used a small helper function to extract the stuck inner
expression or final values and produce a set of irreducible terms.

As you can see, this program either doesn't get stuck and produces
@racket[add1], or it gets stuck trying to multiply a number by
@racket[add1].

We can also verify the safety of programs rejected by typical type
systems.  For example, this program never produces a run-time type
error (because it loops), but is ill-typed according to the @racket[â¢]
judgment:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-term safe
  (if0 Î© (5 7) (add1 add1)))

(final-states
  (apply-reduction-relation* -->vÏ^ (term (injÏâ safe))))
]

Note that this program never reaches a stuck state.

Moreover, we are given much more detail about what happens at run-time
compared to a typical type system.  Suppose we had instead written
this buggy factorial function that messes up the base case:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-term fact-5-zero
  ((Î¼ (fact : (num -> num))
     (Î» ([n : num])
       (if0 n
            0
            (* n (fact (sub1 n))))))
   5))
]

By inspecting the trace graph for this program, it's easy to see that
all final states are either @racket[0] or involve a multiplication by
@racket[0].  Thus we can safely predict that if this program produces
a result, it will be zero.

We can recast classic forms of program analysis in the AAM setting.
For example, higher-order control flow analysis is understood as the
process of predicting, for each application in a program, which lambda
term could be applied (i.e. where can control transfer to at that
point).  It's easy to compute this analysis from the abstract trace
graph: for each reachable application, the next state will be a push
to the stack, putting the function expression in the control string
position.  Any lambda term which could be applied is just the set of
functions reachable from this state with the same stack.  So we can
read off CFA results from the graph.  Temporal properties can also be
discovered by examing the graph.  For example, imagining we carried
out the AAM recipe for a richer language that included file I/O, we
could verify files are always opened before written to, closed only
after opening, and never double-closed.

@section{Going further}

You have now seen the basics of semantic modelling in Redex and the
AAM approach to designing sound and computable approximations to
program behavior.  This tutorial has only touched on the basics, but
it's possible to go much further with both.

@subsection{Going further with Redex}

Redex also includes features for property-based random testing, which
have not been covered here.  These features are great for testing
formal claims about semantics in a lightweight way.  It's often a
useful first step before trying to @emph{prove} something about your
semantics.

Redex also has features for typesetting your semantics.  For example,
you can render reduction relations, judgments, etc.:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(render-reduction-relation r)
]

These features enable you to typeset a paper directly from a Redex
model, avoiding the tedious work and possibility of introducing errors
by transliterating to LaTeX.  You can export PDF or PS figures or you
can write your entire article in Racket's Scribble language, which was
used to prepare this document.

It's also possible to take advantage of many of the other features in
the Racket toolkit for designing languages.  For example, it's pretty
easy to turn a Redex model into a ``@tt{#lang}'' language,
integrating it in to the IDE and giving users a REPL for interacting
with the model.  Once you have a @tt{#lang} version of your model,
it's easy to deploy web REPL to make online demos and interactive
documentation.

For more details on Redex, see the Redex book@~cite[bib:redex] and
docs.  For a paper with several case studies developing models drawn
from published papers, see the @emph{Run Your Research}
paper@~cite[bib:run-your-research].  For examples of papers developed
completely in Scribble and Redex, see @emph{Gradual Typing for
First-Class Classes}@~cite[bib:gradual-typing-first-class-classes],
@emph{Constraining Delimited Control with
Contracts}@~cite[bib:constraining-delim-control], or the source code
for this tutorial.


@subsection{Going futher with AAM}

The basic idea of AAM opens up several avenues for further research.
One is simply to scale the analysis to richer languages.  The original
@emph{Abstracting Abstract Machine} paper@~cite[bib:aam] covers more
advanced language features such as mutable references, first-class
control operators, and stack inspection, and extends naturally to
handle concurrency@~cite[bib:aam-concurrency]. Subsequent research
based on AAM has applied the technique to Javascript@~cite[bib:jsai
bib:js], Dalvik (a JVM-like machine for the Android
platform)@~cite[bib:entry-point-saturation bib:anadroid], and
Racket@~cite[bib:hose bib:scv].

Another avenue to explore is to import ideas from run-time systems
into abstract interpretation via AAM.  For example, precision is lost
in AAM whenever several values end up at the same heap location.  An
obvious idea is to incorporate a garbage collector into the machine.
The abstract garbage collector is the natural lifting of the concrete
collector for the machine with the set-based heap.  This idea improves
the precision and performance of the analysis and creates a kind of
dynamic polymorphism that would be hard to imagine under traditional
static analysis formulations such as constraint-based analyses.  In
the same vein, we can take ideas for speeding up intepretation by
writing a compiler and apply them to abstract
interpretation@~cite[bib:oaam].  We can also import ideas for the
structuring of extensible interpreters in order to structure abstract
interpreters.  For example, our abstract machine semantics is
implicitly organized around a state and non-determinism monad, which
can be made explicit@~cite[bib:monadic].  Going a step further, we can
use monad transformers to automatically construct abstract
interpreters out of off-the-shelf
abstractions@~cite[bib:galois-transformers].

The basic AAM approach approximates a potential infinite-state
transition system with a finite state machine.  This is a fairly
heavy-handed way of achieving decidability and there's been work on
increasing the power of the abstraction model to that of pushdown system.
There have been several formulations of such an
analysis@~cite[bib:cfa2 bib:pdcfa bib:aam-jfp], but the basic idea is
that you skip the heap-allocated continuation step presented here and
leave the stack in place when abstracting.  It's not hard to see that
the resulting machine has a state that consists of finite component
(the closure and heap) and a control stack whose alphabet of stack
frames is drawn from a finite alphabet.  Since the machine always
treats the stack in a stack-like manner, i.e. it only inspects the top
element and pushes and pops single frames at a time, it forms a
pushdown automata.  Unlike the finite state abstraction, the resulting
machine always matches function calls and returns precisely.  However,
the added computational power requires different fixed-point
algorithms since iterating the transition relation may not terminate.
Care must also be taken when language features are included that don't
obey the stack discipline of a pushdown automaton.  For example,
garbage collection or first-class control operators may require
traversing the stack, which is not permitted in the pushdown model;
consequently, special purpose algorithms have been developed to walk
the fine line between pushdown models and decidability for control
operators@~cite[bib:cfa2-callcc bib:aac] and GC@~cite[bib:pdgc
bib:pdgc-jfp].  Recently, a simple algorithm for pushdown CFA has been
developed whose time complexity is cubic when using an abstract
allocation strategy like the one used in these notes, which is the
same complexity as the best finite state
algorithm@~cite[bib:pdcfa-for-free].

The AAM approach starts from a machine semantics and produces a
computable abstraction to predict the behavior that arises at
run-time.  As such, it produces a @emph{whole-program} analysis.  It
may seem that the approach is fundamentally at odds with a modular
analysis since it's so closely tied to the machine semantics, which
are necessarily (it would seem) defined for whole programs.  Modular
higher-order flow analyses are few and far
between@~cite[bib:shivers-phd bib:componential] in part because
analyzing incomplete programs is difficult since behavioral values may
escape to or be provided by the unknown, external world.  However, the
AAM approach can be extended to perform modular analysis.  Rather than
solving the modularity problem @emph{after} abstraction, an
alternative approach is to construct a concrete semantics of modular
(or incomplete) programs@~cite[bib:hose bib:scv bib:counterexamples]
and then run through the usual AAM steps to obtain a modular abstract
interpreter.

@;{
@section{Metatheory}

We can formalize this informal claim about the relation between
@racket[-->vÏ] and @racket[-->vÏ].

First, let's make the connection between context and continuations
manifest with the following metafunctions, which are not used during
reduction, but useful to state formal relationships between
representations:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  K->E : K -> E
  [(K->E ()) hole]
  [(K->E ((if0 [] C_0 C_1) F ...))
   (in-hole (K->E (F ...)) (if0 hole C_0 C_1))]
  [(K->E ((V ... [] C ...) F ...))
   (in-hole (K->E (F ...)) (V ... hole C ...))])

(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  E->K : E -> K
  [(E->K hole) ()]
  [(E->K (if0 E C_0 C_1))
   (F ... (if0 [] C_0 C_1))
   (where (F ...) (E->K E))]
  [(E->K (V ... E C ...))
   (F ... (V ... [] C ...))
   (where (F ...) (E->K E))])
]

We can use Redex's random testing facility to test that @racket[E->K]
and @racket[K->E] are inverses:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
;(redex-check PCFÏ E (equal? (term E) (term (K->E (E->K E)))))
;(redex-check PCFÏ K (equal? (term K) (term (E->K (K->E K)))))
]

The above expressions look for counterexamples for the claims @emph{for
all contexts @racket[E], @racket[(K->E (E->K E))] equals @racket[E]};
and @emph{for all continuations @racket[K], @racket[(E->K (K->E K))]
equals @racket[K]}.

We can now state a ``representation'' relation between states and
closures.  A state and closure are in the relation whenever the state
is a representation of the closure:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
(define-relation PCFÏ
  âÏÏ â Ï Ã C
  [(âÏÏ V V)]
  [(âÏÏ (C_0 K) C_1)   
   (where C_1 (in-hole (K->E K) C_0))])
]

At this point, we can make a claim:

If @racket[Ï] @racket[âÏÏ] @racket[C], then either:
@itemlist[
@item{if @racket[Ï] = @racket[V] for some @racket[V], then @racket[C] = @racket[V],}
@item{if @racket[Ï -->vÏ Ïâ²] by an eval, continute, or halt transition, then
      @racket[Ïâ²] @racket[âÏÏ] @racket[C],}
@item{if @racket[Ï -->vÏ Ïâ²] by an apply transition, then
      @racket[C -->vÏ Câ²], and @racket[Ïâ²] @racket[âÏÏ] @racket[Câ²].}]

This invariant on reduction can be formalized as a predicate and
verify it on some examples:

@interaction[#:eval redex-eval
@code:comment{Check above claim holds at each step of computation}
(define-metafunction PCFÏ
  inv : Ï C -> boolean
  [(inv V C) (âÏÏ V C)]
  @code:comment{Ï -->vÏ Ïâ² by eval, continue, or halt.}
  [(inv Ï C)
   (inv Ï_1 C)
   (where #t (âÏÏ Ï C))
   (where ((any_rule Ï_1))
          ,(apply-reduction-relation/tag-with-names -->vÏ (term Ï)))
   (where (_ ... any_rule _ ...)
          ("ev-if" "ev-app" "co-if" "co-app" "halt"))]
  @code:comment{Ï -->vÏ Ïâ² by apply transition.}
  [(inv Ï C)    
   (inv Ï_1 C_1)
   (where #t (âÏÏ Ï C))
   (where (Ï_1)
          ,(apply-reduction-relation -->vÏ (term Ï)))
   (where (C_1)
          ,(apply-reduction-relation -->vÏ (term C)))]
  [(inv Ï C) #f])

(term (inv ((fact-5 ()) ()) (fact-5 ())))
]


Similary, @racket[-->vÏ] reduction in turn is just like @racket[-->v]
but with more transitions corresponding to substitution.  (It's more
complicated to express this invariant because the representation
relation must be defined modulo consistent renaming of variables.)
